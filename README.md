# Repository scanner tool

This project was thrown together to scan a given repository for commit messages for an outcome tag similar to the repository tool, may make a web interface based on this one dayâ„¢.

## Usage

```
go run . <repoUrl> <privateKeyFile>

>>

Outcome 1.1.1.1 has 1 commits
Outcome 1.1.1.2 has 2 commits
Outcome 1.1.1.3 has 3 commits
Outcome 1.1.1.4 has 4 commits
Outcome 1.1.1.5 has 5 commits

... (for each module)

```

For me the command looks like:

```
go run . git@bitbucket.org:15027887/personal-reflections.git C:/Users/Jordan/.ssh/id_rsa

```

## Notes

Currently only one repository is scanned, the majority of mine are only in 1 repository but I may enhance this in future.

Ensure the repository URL provided is of the SSH (git@bitbucket) format as opposed to the http address.

WARNING - Do not blindly give programs access to your private SSH key file, review the code and ensure you are happy with it
While this program should not do anything malicious, it makes use of external (trusted and respected) packages that could potentially be doing anything with your private keys.
